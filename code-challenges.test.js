// ASSESSMENT 2: Coding Practical Questions with Jest

// Please read all questions thoroughly
// If you get stuck, leave comments to help us understand your thought process

// Use test driven development to complete the following questions
// Add appropriate dependencies: $ yarn add jest

// Reminder: The test will call your function
// Run the file with the following command: $ yarn jest
// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: Create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns an array with all the numbers multiplied by 3.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.


// // b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

// // Pseudo code:

// // --------------------1) Create a function that takes a object as an argument and decides if the number inside it is evenly divisible by three or not.
const cars = {
    vehicle: 1
    vehicle: 2
    vehicle: 3
}
    
// // a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.
describe()
  
//   // Test cases using Jest
//  
// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

  

// Pseudo code: create a function that takes a object as an argument and decides if the number inside it is evenly divisble by 3 or not 
// i would do this but i just dont know how to set up a object as a argument. im watching the lecture but its not clicking to me .

// --------------------2) Create a function that takes in an array of words and returns an array with all the words capitalized.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

const randomNouns1 = ["streetlamp", "potato", "teeth", "conclusion", "nephew"]
// Expected output: ["Streetlamp", "Potato", "Teeth", "Conclusion", "Nephew"]
const randomNouns2 = ["temperature", "database", "chopsticks", "mango"]
// Expected output: ["Temperature", "Database", "Chopsticks", "Mango"]



// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

// Pseudo code: its not clicking with me on how to properyly set up a test . i know how to start the application in the terminal and i know how to run the jest test itself . but i dont understand the logic to create a code too run.it doesnt make sense to me .
